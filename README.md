# Agglomerative-Hierarchical-Clustering

Dataset- An automobile manufacturer has developed prototypes for a new vehicle. Before introducing the new model into its range, the manufacturer wants to determine which existing vehicles on the market are most like the prototypes--that is, how vehicles can be grouped, which group is the most similar with the model, and therefore which models they will be competing against.

Using Agglomerative clustering we find the most distinctive clusters of vehicles. It will summarize the existing vehicles and help manufacture to make decision about new models simply.

The featuresets includes price in thousands (price), engine size (engine_s), horsepower (horsepow), wheelbase (wheelbas), width (width), length (length), curb weight (curb_wgt), fuel capacity (fuel_cap) and fuel efficiency (mpg).
